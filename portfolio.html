                    <h3>Japanese Breakfast</h3>
                    <p>
                        Japanese Breakfast is an alternative pop band headed by musician
                        Michelle Zauner. Zauner started the band as a side project in
                        2013, when she was leading the Philadelphia-based emo group Little
                        Big League. She has said that she named the band after seeing a
                        <abbr title="graphics interchange format">GIF</abbr> of Japanese
                        breakfast and deciding that the term would be considered <em>"exotic"</em>
                        to Americans; she also thought it would make others wonder what a
                        Japanese breakfast consists of.
